# RB109 Log

Logging my progress so I can make commits even on days I push no code. Numbering continued from RB101/LOG.md. Newest entries first.

## Day 190: Wednesday September 8, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 0

**Progress**: N/A

**My Feelings**: Had a migraine today so couldn't work. I feel my body is testing my resolve in trying to stay optimistic and lower my expectations without getting too down on myself. OOF.

## Day 189: Tuesday September 7, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 6

**Progress**:
- [x] Review Anki backlog
- [x] Take notes on Practice Test observations and improvements
- [x] Schedule a study session

**My Feelings**: A fairly successful day reviewing the practice test I took a few weeks ago. It's really difficult to evaluate myself. I was able to identify some knowledge gaps so that should guide me through the rest of the week.

## Day 188: Monday September 6, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 3

**Progress**:
- [x] Catching up on messages, news, events
- [x] Review Anki backlog

**My Feelings**: Rough start back from health break but trying not to get superstitious about it. Any momentum is good, there's no practical purpose in haggling over how much and which types of work "count". Gotta work with my own psychology here...

___
*Unscheduled break for health **8/31 - 9/5** (6 days). My chronic pain condition flared up and I got knocked out for almost a week. At the urging of my spouse, I took some time off to take care of myself. Once the initial stress of falling behind schedule wore off, I was glad I took some time to reassess my goals and adjust my expectations, which I had unintentionally allowed to get out of control. Aiming a bit lower for the forseeable future.*

## Day 187: Monday August 30, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 4

**Progress**:
- [x] Fix GitHub repo issue
- [x] Review Anki backlog

**My Feelings**: Big time suck today trying to get my notes repository sorted out. Starting to get aggravated with myself.

## Days 185-186: Saturday August 28, 2021 - Sunday August 29, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 0

**Progress**: N/A

**My Feelings**: Another weekend another unexpected family visit. I've talked in here before about being more protective of my time, but I could also be more proactive and move the bulk of my work to weekdays. That may be the best solution. I am far less likely to be interrupted on weekdays (or so it seems thus far).

## Day 184: Friday August 27, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 2

**Progress**:
- [x] Catch up on podcast

**My Feelings**: Still fatigued from overworking on Wednesday. It felt necessary to get kind of a preview for the assessment and where I'm at but lord did it burn me out.

## Day 183: Thursday August 26, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 6

**Progress**:
- [x] Fix `git`
- [x] Clone `ls_notes` repo to local Documents
  - [x] Locate and delete duplicates
- [x] SPOT Study Session at 4PM EDT

**My Feelings**: I'm glad I attempted some practice questions yesterday because I think that prepared me to make good use of today's SPOT study session. Still need to review my answers in more depth but got some clarity from the lead and other students. Also wrestled with some `GitHub` authentication issues and backed up my notes.

## Day 182: Wednesday August 25, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 10

**Progress**:
- [ ] ~~Study w/another student~~
- [x] Assemble practice questions
    - [x] Lesson 2 Quiz
    - [x] Lesson 4 Quiz
    - [x] Lesson 5 Quiz
- [x] Practice test
  - [x] Assemble the test
  - [x] Take the test

**My Feelings**: This is close to the most work I've ever done in a day, which is ridiculous because I had a family emergency later and sadly had to cancel a study session with another student. I wanted to just rip off the Band-Aid and get a feel for what the written assessment was going to be like, so I made up a fake one for myself. Tomorrow I will analyze my answers and I think that should give me a good idea of what I need to work on.

## Day 181: Tuesday August 24, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 5

**Progress**:
- [x] Begin RB101 indexing
  - [x] Begin "Intro to Programming"
- [x] Assemble practice questions
  - [x] From RB101 through Lesson 4

**My Feelings**: It's a miracle I got anything at all done today because there were meltdowns happening at home. I just have to steal time to work where I can and keep pushing through. I'm gonna have the same problems when I'm working too, so best to try to adjust to it now.

## Day 180: Monday August 23, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 7

**Progress**:
- [x] Read LS Student Blogs on 109 Prep
- [x] Figure out my mental block
- [x] Begin organizing practice test

**My Feelings**: I did better than I expected today! Set my expectations low, tried to really dig in and figure out what I needed to do and pursue in order to make myself feel more comfortable with the material at hand. Reading about other peoples' experiences has given me some good ideas.

## Days 178-179: Saturday August 21, 2021 - Sunday August 22, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 0

**Progress**: N/A

**My Feelings**: Running behind schedule but took some time off this weekend to recalibrate and strategize since I seem to be having so much trouble digging into study for the assessments. I know enough about myself to know this is an emotional problem, not a lack of capability. However, that is still sometimes hard to believe.

## Day 177: Friday August 20, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 3

**Progress**:
- [x] Input Anki cards
- [x] Review talk on Bloom's Taxonomy
- [ ] Practice writing problems

**My Feelings**: Friday's are always busy, but it doesn't help that I feel like I'm at kind of an impasse in my studies. Will dedicate more time tomorrow to figuring that out. Reviewing that student talk did help me start to figure out how to focus.

## Day 176: Thursday August 19, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 4

**Progress**:
- [x] Input Anki cards
  - [x] From Object Passing notes
- [x] Continue reviewing [the articles](https://medium.com/how-i-started-learning-coding-from-scratch/advices-for-109-written-assessment-part-1-6f7fa821cf84) in Srdjan's review (review-ception)
  - [x] [Variables as Pointers](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/more_stuff#variables_as_pointers)
    - [x] Revise notes
- [x] Sign up for a study group

**My Feelings**: Got less done than expected because I had some physical and emotional recovery to do from the day before. Will have to try to catch back up tomorrow.

## Day 175: Wednesday August 18, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 0

**Progress**: N/A

**My Feelings**: Today went off the RAILS with numerous unscheduled tasks that consumed my day. Very annoying.

**Pomodoros Completed**: 6

**Progress**:
- [x] Continue reviewing [the articles](https://medium.com/how-i-started-learning-coding-from-scratch/advices-for-109-written-assessment-part-1-6f7fa821cf84) in Srdjan's review (review-ception)

    - [x] Revise notes
- [x] Input Anki cards
  - [x] From Object Passing notes

**My Feelings**: I thought since I'm already making a to do list in markdown every day I might as well include it here! And wow, I got through a lot of material today. Finally finished reviewing the article series on object passing and I felt I grasped far more on what was my 3rd pass of the material. Doesn't seem as conceptually dense and impenetrable anymore. The circuitousness path of mastery based learning really seems to work.

## Day 173: Monday August 16, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 5

**Progress**: Continued my review of object passing, taking notes, making new notecards

**My Feelings**: Could have done more today. Let household chores take priority. Still, a good start to the week. Feel I can do more tomorrow. Always hard coming off an unfocused weekend.

## Day 172: Sunday August 15, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 0

**Progress**: Worked on my personal site a bit today.

**My Feelings**: I've been officially subscribed at Launch School for 6 months. Mixed feelings. Happy that I'm sticking with it, but a little anxious about assessment prep. This is the first big hurdle and until I jump it I'm kind of in a limbo of self-doubt. Gotta keep pushing ahead.

## Day 171: Saturday August 14, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 2

**Progress**: Writing out my study plan for the weekend and then not doing it

**My Feelings**: Focusing has been really, really tough the last few days. A lot of things on my mind. Really pulling out every trick in the book and not having a lot of success. Trying to write it all out and see if that helps.

## Day 170: Friday August 13, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 7

**Progress**: 109 study session and taking notes

**My Feelings**: Decided to stop being timid and just dive in to a study session so I could get a better idea of how to prepare for the assessment. Glad I did, it gave me a lot of clarity and direction. But man, it really sapped my brain power. Gonna need to build up some mental stamina for the test.

## Day 169: Thursday August 12, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 7

**Progress**: Reviewing object passing and taking notes.

**My Feelings**: Had a much better day today. Wrote out my anxieties and did some planning before sitting down to work. That seemed to help a lot. Revising notes and synthesizing concepts is tough work, especially since I find it impossible to do with music on, but I'm slowly making progress.

## Day 168: Wednesday August 11, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 1

**Progress**: Taking notes

**My Feelings**: Um... A little sheepish about this one. Just could not find the focus, kept getting distracted. Feeling anxious about the assessment and other things in my life lead to a lot of avoidance. The good news is that days like this used to be far more frequent for me and are lessening with time and practice. Try to do better tomorrow...

## Day 167: Tuesday August 10, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 6

**Progress**: Catching up on news from my missed days, begin reviewing blog series on Object Passing in Ruby and taking notes, catching up on Anki deck.

**My Feelings**: Today was the first day back to school and had some COVID related errands so still getting back in the groove of things, but it's a start.

## Days 163-166: Friday August 6, 2021 - Monday August 9, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 0

**Progress**: N/A

**My Feelings**: Had to take 2 days off, which cascaded into 4 days. Had a convergence of baby shower, back to school for our high schooler, and a pain flare. Trying to get back in it.

## Day 162: Thursday August 5, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 5

**Progress**: Finish Srdjan's blog, review video

**My Feelings**: Not feeling my best today, so it was a bit tough to stay on top of work today. Plus the mental block of getting started because my coursework right now is so nebulous. Trying to drill down on a strategy.

## Day 161: Wednesday August 4, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 3

**Progress**: Began reading and taking notes on Srdjan's blog posts for the written exam.

**My Feelings**: Got a late start today and ran out of time. Frustrating. Had a hard time prioritizing today.

## Day 160: Tuesday August 3, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 8

**Progress**: Reviewed notes from live session, synthesized and rewrote parts, created new Anki cards from the material. Began reviewing assessment criteria.

**My Feelings**: Today was a slog! Really hard for me to get back into the mindset of taking notes. Before I was letting the material kind of wash over me, now I have to dig in and make sure I really understand the concepts. It's tough!

## Day 159: Monday August 2, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 7

**Progress**: Complete live session videos and notes.

**My Feelings**: Always feels good when I can get a good amount of work done on a Monday. Sets the tone for the rest of the week.

## Day 158: Sunday August 1, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 0

**Progress**: N/A

**My Feelings**: My scheduled day off. Didn't quite hit my quota this week, which is frustrating, but things got a little nuts. Gonna have to make up for it next week.

## Day 157: Saturday July 31, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 5

**Progress**: Taking notes on the video series. Halfway through part 2.

**My Feelings**: Starting to settle into a rhythm for this new section of exam prep. It takes a lot more active concentration and can be tiring, but I'm trying to build up some stamina in addition to keeping up with daily chores.

## Day 156: Friday July 30, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 5

**Progress**: Taking notes on the video series.

**My Feelings**: Fridays are always tough to get work done, so this is more than my usual, but I'm going to need a lot more if I'm going to catch up this week.

## Day 155: Thursday July 29, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 6

**Progress**: Setting up new git repo for 109, taking notes on assessment process, begin watching video series.

**My Feelings**: Didn't get as much done today as I would like, fighting against git and also catching up on household tasks from earlier this week. Don't love being behind, but just trying to put consistent time in for now.

## Day 154: Wednesday July 28, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 7

**Progress**: Turning in final Twenty-One corrections, reviewing assessment prep documents for RB109.

**My Feelings**: It's kind of a weird feeling moving into this next phase of learning, preparation for the assessments. I feel like I'm once again changing my study structure and routines around a brand new objective. I will get the hang of it but it's a little intimidating.

## Day 153: Tuesday July 27, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 0

**Progress**: N/A

**My Feelings**: Scheduled day off for family time.

## Day 152: Monday July 26, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 1

**Progress**: Review Twenty-One corrections, review 109 assessment criteria.

**My Feelings**: We had an unexpected summer school related meltdown at the house today, so work got derailed.
