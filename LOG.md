Logging my progress so I can make commits even on days I push no code. Numbering continued from RB101/LOG.md. Newest entries first.

### Days 172: Sunday August 15, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 0

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my personal site a bit today.

**My Feelings**: I've been officially subscribed at Launch School for 6 months. Mixed feelings. Happy that I'm sticking with it, but a little anxious about assessment prep. This is the first big hurdle and until I jump it I'm kind of in a limbo of self-doubt. Gotta keep pushing ahead.

### Days 171: Saturday August 14, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 2

**Today's Progress**: Writing out my study plan for the weekend and then not doing it

**My Feelings**: Focusing has been really, really tough the last few days. A lot of things on my mind. Really pulling out every trick in the book and not having a lot of success. Trying to write it all out and see if that helps.

### Days 170: Friday August 13, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 7

**Today's Progress**: 109 study session and taking notes

**My Feelings**: Decided to stop being timid and just dive in to a study session so I could get a better idea of how to prepare for the assessment. Glad I did, it gave me a lot of clarity and direction. But man, it really sapped my brain power. Gonna need to build up some mental stamina for the test.

### Days 169: Thursday August 12, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 7

**Today's Progress**: Reviewing object passing and taking notes.

**My Feelings**: Had a much better day today. Wrote out my anxieties and did some planning before sitting down to work. That seemed to help a lot. Revising notes and synthesizing concepts is tough work, especially since I find it impossible to do with music on, but I'm slowly making progress.

### Days 168: Wednesday August 11, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 1

**Today's Progress**: Taking notes

**My Feelings**: Um... A little sheepish about this one. Just could not find the focus, kept getting distracted. Feeling anxious about the assessment and other things in my life lead to a lot of avoidance. The good news is that days like this used to be far more frequent for me and are lessening with time and practice. Try to do better tomorrow...

**Today's Progress**: Finish Srdjan's blog, review video

**My Feelings**: Not feeling my best today, so it was a bit tough to stay on top of work today. Plus the mental block of getting started because my coursework right now is so nebulous. Trying to drill down on a strategy.

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed notes from live session, synthesized and rewrote parts, created new Anki cards from the material. Began reviewing assessment criteria.

**My Feelings**: Today was a slog! Really hard for me to get back into the mindset of taking notes. Before I was letting the material kind of wash over me, now I have to dig in and make sure I really understand the concepts. It's tough!
