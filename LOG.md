# RB109 Log

Logging my progress so I can make commits even on days I push no code. Numbering continued from RB101/LOG.md. Newest entries first.

### Day 156: Friday July 30, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 5

**Today's Progress**: Taking notes on the video series.

**My Feelings**: Fridays are always tough to get work done, so this is more than my usual, but I'm going to need a lot more if I'm going to catch up this week.

### Day 155: Thursday July 29, 2021

**My Feelings**: Didn't get as much done today as I would like, fighting against git and also catching up on household tasks from earlier this week. Don't love being behind, but just trying to put consistent time in for now.

**My Feelings**: It's kind of a weird feeling moving into this next phase of learning, preparation for the assessments. I feel like I'm once again changing my study structure and routines around a brand new objective. I will get the hang of it but it's a little intimidating.
