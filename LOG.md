# RB109 Log

Logging my progress so I can make commits even on days I push no code. Numbering continued from RB101/LOG.md. Newest entries first.

### Day 154: Wednesday July 28, 2021

**Pomodoros Completed**: 7

**Today's Progress**: Turning in final Twenty-One corrections, reviewing assessment prep documents for RB109.

**My Feelings**: It's kind of a weird feeling moving into this next phase of learning, preparation for the assessments. I feel like I'm once again changing my study structure and routines around a brand new objective. I will get the hang of it but it's a little intimidating.
